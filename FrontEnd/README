This directory contains files to create a front end for a
C-- compiler using flex and yacc.

SOFTWARE ASSUMPTIONS
====================
This software has been tested on Ubuntu systems; it may or may not work
properly on other systems.

To compile and run this code, you need the compiler construction tools
flex and yacc; the GNU tool bison can be used instead of yacc.  These tools
are available on lectura.cs.arizona.edu.  If you want to install them on your
own computer, you can find instructions for doing so at

  https://ccm.net/computing/linux/1711-how-to-install-flex-and-bison-under-ubuntu/


BUILDING THE SYSTEM
===================
The file 'Makefile' in this directory uses yacc.  If you are using bison
instead of yacc, use the command 'bison -y' instead of 'yacc' in this
line in Makefile; see "man bison" for details.

Type "make", this will create an executable named "compile".


INVOKING THE PROGRAM
====================
The program 'compile' reads from stdin and writes error messages to stderr.
If compiled with the flag -DDEBUG, syntax trees are printed to stdout.  Other
than this, syntactically correct input files are accepted silently.


SYNTAX TREE PROCESSING
======================
The function process_syntax_tree(), defined in the file process_syntax_tree.c,
can be used to process the syntax tree of each function.  This function is
called by the parser once the syntax tree for a function has been constructed;
the arguments passed into it are: (1) a pointer to the global symbol table entry
for the function name; and (2) a pointer to the root of the syntax tree for the
function body.

In the code that you start out with, process_syntax_tree() conditionally (if the
symbol DEBUG is defined at compile time) calls a function to traverse and print
out the syntax tree it is passed.  You can modify this function and add your own
code to process syntax trees as desired.


FILES:
=====
These are the files present initially:

  README	this file

  Makefile	builds the front end; this results in an executable
		called "parse".
		
		Defining the symbol DEBUG in the variable CFLAGS will
		cause the syntax tree to be printed out after processing
		each function.  NOTE: This behavior can (and should) be
		changed by modifying the function process_syntax_tree()
		defined in the file process_syntax_tree.c.

  main.c	The driver program that calls the parser.

  error.h	Defines various types of errors for special handling.

  error.c	Routines for reporting error messages.

  parser.y	Yacc specification for the parser.

  print.c       Code for printing stuff out.  Right now it contains code
                for printing out syntax trees.

  protos.h      Prototypes.  Right now it contains prototypes for 
  	        syntax tree accessor functions.

  scanner.l	Flex specification for the scanner.

  symbol-table.h  Typedefs etc. for symbol tables.

  symbol-table.c  Code for maintaining and accessing the symbol table.

  syntax-tree.h  Typedefs etc. for syntax trees.

  syntax-tree.c  Code for constructing the syntax tree.

  util.h        Declarations and prototypes for utility routines.

  util.c        Assorted utilities.

Additionally, the following files are created during the build process:

  y.tab.h, 
  y.tab.c, 
  y.output	Created by yacc.

  lex.yy.c	Created by flex.

GLOBAL VARIABLES:
================

  char *id_name		When the scanner recognizes an identifier, this
			variable points to (a copy of) the lexeme.  This is
			what needs to be accessed when you subsequently
			want to get at the identifier's name, since by
			that time yytext may have been long since overwritten.

			Defined by the function id_or_keywd() in file
						scanner.l.

  int ival              When a scanner recognizes an integer or character
                        constant, this variable is assigned the value of
                        that constant.  Defined in scanner.l.

  int linenum		Contains the line number currently being processed.
			Typically used in error messages.  Defined in scanner.l.

  int errstate		Indicates what kind of an error has occurred.  The
			parser treats a few kinds of errors specially: the
			nature of such special errors is communicated to yyerror()
			via the variable errstate.  For the values this can
			take on, see errmrgs.h --- the value ORDINARY refers
			to errors that don't get any special handling.


SYMBOL TABLES
=============
Declarations pertaining to symbol tables are in the file symbol-table.h.



SYNTAX TREES
============
Declarations pertaining to syntax trees are in the file syntax-tree.h.
Components of syntax tree nodes can be accessed via the accessor functions
whose prototypes are given in protos.h.
